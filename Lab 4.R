#The shape of the histogram increases as the x grows higher, therefore, as the x-axis increases, the corruption value is higher. 
#The curve of the graphic gets really high at one point and then decreases almost exponentially.
corruption_std
#Outliers: Rwanda and Singapure.

#MINIHACK 3: Descriptive plots

#It seems that in this graphic there exists two maximums that are like two normal distributions combined.รง
psych::describeBy(x=world_happiness_sim$Service,group=world_happiness_sim$War)
#Both of the means correspond to the max vars (0.26 and 0.7).

#MINIHACK 4: Correlations

#EX3
cor(world_happiness_num$Happiness, world_happiness_num$Freedom,use="complete.obs")
cor(world_happiness_num$Corruption, world_happiness_num$Freedom,use="complete.obs")
#We can see those countries with low freedom have high corruption (as none fights for their rights). However, those with freedom are happier.
#EX4
cor(world_happiness_num, use="pairwise.complete.obs")
#EX5
?cor
#The complete.obs and pairwise are different.
#When using 'complete.obs' the missing values are handled by case wise deletion (if no complete cases-> error). 
#On the other hand, the 'pairwise.complete.obs' variable the correlation between each pair of variables is computed using all 
#complete pairs of observations on those variables.
#EX6
cor(world_happiness_num$GDP, world_happiness_num$Happiness,use="complete.obs")
cor(world_happiness_num$GDP, world_happiness_num$Happiness,use="pairwise.complete.obs")
#The correlation in both of the previous cases are the same 0.8193273 = 0.82
